\section{Introduction and THEIA Overview - GDOG, Bob, JRK, Michi}

Standard intro

Include description of phased deployment

e.g. refer to THEIA-i, THEIA-ii, THEIA-iii

Define the baseline design for each here, so that physics sections can simply refer back

e.g. THEIA-ii might be 50ktonne 10\% WbLS, 90\% coverage

whereas THEIA-iii might be the above with 5\% WbLS but a bag containing LS + Te/Xe

\subsubsection{Indirect Dark Matter ?? }
From Michi -- there is still some interest in detecting decay/annihilation neutrinos in the multi-MeV range where THEIA would probably be able to place very competitive limits (as I noticed speaking to a theorist from Brussels a few weeks ago). It would be an addition to the antineutrino WG. Certainly, it?s rather low priority, but we could put it there as a place-holder.
